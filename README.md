Show your product pricing in USD, XMR, and sats on wordpress and woocommerce with this php file while keeping the back-end price in local currency.

<H1>Background</H1>
Forked from woocommerce-sats to add usd and XMR, as well as setting it to display multiple currency prices on the shop page, not just product pages.
</p>

<H1>Required Setup</H1>
First off, you will need the following on your website. If you need help with these, there are tons of articles on how do each one.
<ul>
  <li>Wordpress installed</li>
  <li>Woocommerce plugin installed</li>
  <li>Products denominated in fiat both in Woocommerce settings and on each of the product pages</li>
  <li>Child theme installed</li>
  <li>Bitcoin and Moneropayment gateway like btcpayserver </li>
</ul>
<H1>Code Installation</H1>
Next, you should copy or download the php file, then add the modified code to the functions.php file in your Child wordpress theme. To do this, you need to find your child theme's functions.php file. You can access the functions.php file of your child theme by going to Appearance > Theme Editor in your WordPress dashboard and selecting your child theme and finally the functions.php file. Then, add the modified code at the end of the file and save the changes.
