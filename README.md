# woocommerce-sats
Show your product pricing in sats on wordpress and woocommerce with this php file while keeping the back-end price in local currency.

<H1>Background</H1>
I decided to create this php file after downloading a cRyPtO checkout Wordpress plugin that supported a ton of ðŸ’©coins. As a bitcoin-only company, I couldn't use their product in good conscience and the part that pushed me over the edge is when I asked for help with a simple conversion within the script from BTC to sats and the response was "nobody has ever requested sats".

So I booted up the good ole Chat AI and after a couple hours, I was able to create the functions.php file for you to use!

<H1>Required Setup</H1>
First off, you will need the following on your website. If you need help with these, there are tons of articles on how do each one.
<ul>
  <li>Wordpress installed</li>
  <li>Woocommerce plugin installed</li>
  <li>Products denominated in fiat both in Woocommerce settings and on each of the product pages</li>
  <li>Child theme installed</li>
  <li>Bitcoin payment gateway like btcpayserver.com (kinda goes without saying...)</li>
</ul>
<H1>Code Installation</H1>
Next, you should copy or download the php file, then add the modified code to the functions.php file in your Child wordpress theme. To do this, you need to find your child theme's functions.php file. You can access the functions.php file of your child theme by going to Appearance > Theme Editor in your WordPress dashboard and selecting your child theme. Then, add the modified code at the end of the file and save the changes.

If you have any trouble with the code or installation steps, please let me know and I will update the page and/or php file on this site. Good luck with the project and your bitcoin business!
